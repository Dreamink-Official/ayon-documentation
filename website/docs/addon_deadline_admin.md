## Preparation

For [AWS Thinkbox Deadline](https://www.awsthinkbox.com/deadline) support you need to set a few things up in both AYON and Deadline itself

1. Deploy AYON executable to all nodes of Deadline farm. See [Install & Run](admin_launcher_distribute.md)

2. Enable Deadline Module in the [AYON Admin Settings](admin_settings_system.md#deadline).

3. Set up *Deadline Web API service*. For more details on how to do it, see [here](https://docs.thinkboxsoftware.com/products/deadline/10.1/1_User%20Manual/manual/web-service.html).

4. Point AYON to your deadline webservice URL in the [AYON Admin Settings](admin_settings_system.md#deadline).

5. Install our custom plugin and scripts to your deadline repository. It should be as simple as copying content of `ayon/modules/deadline/repository/custom` to `path/to/your/deadline/repository/custom`.


## Configuration

AYON integration for Deadline consists of two parts:

- The `AYON` Deadline Plug-in
- A `GlobalJobPreLoad` Deadline Script (this gets triggered for each deadline job)

The `GlobalJobPreLoad` handles populating render and publish jobs with proper environment variables using settings from the `AYON` Deadline Plug-in.

The `AYON` Deadline Plug-in must be configured to point to a valid AYON executable location. The executable need to be installed to
destinations accessible by DL process. Check permissions (must be executable and accessible by Deadline process)

- Enable `Tools > Super User Mode` in Deadline Monitor

- Go to `Tools > Configure Plugins...`, find `AYON` in the list on the left side, find location of AYON
executable. It is recommended to use the `ayon_console` executable as it provides a bit more logging.

- In case of multi OS farms, provide multiple locations, each Deadline Worker goes through the list and tries to find the first accessible
 location for itself.

### AYONTileAssembler Plugin
To setup tile rendering copy the `OpenPypeTileAssembler` plugin to the repository;
`[AYON]\ayon\modules\deadline\repository\custom\plugins\OpenPypeTileAssembler` > `[DeadlineRepository]\custom\plugins\OpenPypeTileAssembler`

### Pools

The main pools can be configured at `ayon+settings://deadline/publish/CollectDeadlinePools`, which is applied to the rendering jobs.

The dependent publishing job's pool uses `ayon+settings://deadline/publish/ProcessSubmittedJobOnFarm`. If nothing is specified the pool will fallback to the primary pool above.

The logic for publishing job pool assignment applies to tiling jobs.

## Troubleshooting

You could check [deadline guide](https://community.ynput.io/t/ayon-openpype-deadline-setup/468) for more detailed steps and additional tips.
:::

### Publishing jobs fail directly in DCCs

- Double check that all previously described steps were finished
- Check that `deadlinewebservice` is running on DL server
- Check that user's machine has access to deadline server on configured port

### Jobs are failing on DL side

Each publishing from AYON consists of 2 jobs, first one is rendering, second one is the publishing job (triggered after successful finish of the rendering job).

![Jobs in DL](assets/deadline/admin/deadline_fail.png)

- **<font size="4"> Jobs are failing with `AYON executable was not found` error </font>**

    Check if AYON is installed on the Worker handling this job and ensure `AYON` Deadline Plug-in is properly [configured](#configuration)


- **<font size="4"> Publishing job is failing with `ffmpeg not installed` error </font>**

    AYON executable has to have access to `ffmpeg` executable, check AYON `ayon+settings://ayon_third_party`

    ![FFmpeg setting](assets/deadline/admin/ffmpeg_path.png)

- **<font size="4"> Both jobs finished successfully, but there is no review on Ftrack </font>**

    Make sure that you correctly set published family to be send to Ftrack.

    ![Ftrack Family](assets/ftrack/ftrack-collect-main.png)

    Example: I want send to Ftrack review of rendered images from Harmony :
        - `Host names`: "harmony"
        - `Families`: "render"
        - `Add Ftrack Family` to "Enabled"

    Make sure that you actually configured to create review for published product in `ayon+settings://deadline/publish/ProcessSubmittedJobOnFarm`

    ![Ftrack Family](assets/deadline/admin/deadline_review.png)

    Example: I want to create review for all reviewable products in Harmony :
      - Add "harmony" as a new key an ".*" as a value.


- **<font size="4"> Rendering jobs are stuck in 'Queued' state or failing </font>**

    Make sure that your Deadline is not limiting specific jobs to be run only on specific machines. (Eg. only some machines have installed particular application.)

    Check `ayon+settings://deadline/publish/HarmonySubmitDeadline`

    ![Deadline group](assets/deadline/admin/deadline_group.png)

    Example: I have separated machines with "Harmony" installed into "harmony" group on Deadline. I want rendering jobs published from Harmony to run only on those machines.
