## Default Product Types
### Simple Create Plugins

:::tip Simple Create Plugins
Admins are able to change (remove/add/modify) simple create plugins via [Tray publisher addon settings](https://ayon.ynput.io/docs/addon_traypublisher_admin#creator-plugins).
:::

- `workfiles`: Workfiles are full scenes from any application that are directly edited by artists. They represent a state of work on a task at a given point and are usually not directly referenced into other scenes.
- `model`: Models should only contain geometry data, without any extras like cameras, locators or bones. *Keep in mind that models published from tray publisher are not validated for correctness.* 
- `pointcache`: Alembic or bgeo cache of animated data
- `plate`: Any type of image seqeuence coming from outside of the studio. Usually camera footage, but could also be animatics used for reference.
- `render`: Sequence or single file renders.
- `camera`: Ideally this should be only camera itself with baked animation, however, it can technically also include helper geometry.
- `image`: Any image data can be published as image product type. References, textures, concept art, matte paints. This is a fallback 2d product type for everything that doesn't fit more specific product type.
- `vdb`: Hierarchical data structure for the efficient storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data discretized on three-dimensional grids.
- `matchmove`: Script exported from matchmoving application to be later processed into a tracked camera with additional data.
- `rig`: CG rigged character or prop. Rig should be clean of any extra data and directly loadable into it's respective application.	
- `simpleUnrealTexture`: Texture files with Unreal Engine naming conventions.
- `audio`: Audio files for review or final delivery.


### Editorial Simple

### Batch Movies

It's capable of publishing individual mov files to specific shots based on file name.
<!-- TODO: Add File name pattern once the creator is fixed. 
For context, the Batch mov creator doesn't work. -->

:::note
Currently, This creator doesn't work as expected.
It should be fixed soon.

### CSV Ingest 
This feature allows mass publishing arbitrary files through a CSV file.
It requires a CSV file and then drag and drop it inside the Tray Publisher.
The CSV columns should follow the columns specified in your AYON tray publisher settings.
- `ayon+settings://traypublisher/create/IngestCSV/columns_config/columns`


Find example CSV file here: [ay_240319_0001.zip](https://github.com/ynput/ayon-core/files/14651928/ay_240319_0001.zip)

:::info CSV Ingest
This is a working prototype and doesn't include all expected features.
e.g. it doesn't support creating missing hierarchy folders in case they are missing.
Therefore, please ensure that hierarchy folders exist before publishing.

## Default Validators
Tray Publisher provides simple validators. 
e.g.
- ColorSpace: Validate colorspace look attributes and representation colorspaces.
- Filepaths: Validate existence of source filepaths .
- Frame Ranges: Validating frame range of rendered files against state in AYON.
